> [!NOTE]
> DOF2.1 is an updated include for San Andreas Multiplayer (SA:MP) and Open Multiplayer (OMP), ensuring full compatibility with versions 3.10.10 and 3.10.11 of the Pawno compiler. This update was necessary due to changes in the compiler syntax, which no longer accepts old includes without generating numerous warnings or errors.

> [!TIP]
> You can contribute to the evolution of DOF2.1! Submit improvements, fixes, or new features that enhance the performance and usability of include. It is important that your code is compatible with the latest versions of Pawno to keep the integration smooth and efficient.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is under constant development. Future updates will include performance optimizations and support for additional features of the updated compiler. If you have any problems, please don't hesitate to open a pullrequest or issue.

> [!WARNING]
> To avoid compatibility issues, it is essential that you replace old versions of DOF2.inc with DOF2.1.inc. Also, note whether you use SA:MP or OMP and download the corresponding version from [Release](https://github.com/Collw/DOF2.1-Include/releases)

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure you are using the most recent versions of the compiler. This will help mitigate incompatibility risks and take full advantage of the improvements introduced in the new version.
